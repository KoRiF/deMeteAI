# deMeteAI
Intelligent navigation based on weather data

## deScription
This application allows to navigate through weather observations and the nearest forecast, based on the  [Meteostat project API](https://dev.meteostat.net/python/) using "smart" Delphi components.  

The idea of the project is to create a demo of using live AI script generation and intelligent Delphi components to build an application in the spirit of the Andrej Karpathy's [Software 2.0 concept](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).
